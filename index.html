  	<p>Who <strong>doesn't</strong> like dogs? Maybe cat-people but let's be honest they don't count. Dogs are loyal, happy and will love you unconditionally, unlike some humans... What else can I write about them? </p>
	
	<p> I personally do have dog and his name is Whiskey! He's super lazy and seems to dislike other people and animals a lot. However he will be your friend if you give him some of your human food.</p>
	  
	  
		  <h4>Types of dogs</h4>
	  <p id="last-paragraph">I love fluffy dogs, but also less fluffy dogs. I think every dog deserves a fair chance for happiness and love! No matter the breed or fluff. I love Pitbulls, but also Husky's. The only breed I often dislike are Chihuahuas... (no offence if you have one of those.) </p>
