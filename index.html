  	<p>Who <strong>doesn't</strong> like dogs? Maybe cat-people but let's be honest they don't count. Dogs are loyal, happy and will love you unconditionally, unlike some humans... What else can I write about them? </p>
	
	<p> I personally do have dog and his name is Whiskey! He's super lazy and seems to dislike other people and animals a lot. However he will be your friend if you give him some of your human food.</p>
